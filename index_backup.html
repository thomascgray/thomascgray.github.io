- Hey, I like peeking at source code too!
- This page uses Bootstrap, a custom theme, and a bit more personal styling for the finishing touches
- I was also gonna use a bit of JS so there was a nice scroll effect when you clicked on the navigation links, but I actually kinda agree with the guy over at http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/

				<h5>Evoluted <p class='text-muted sans-serif'>December 2014 - Present<br>Web Developer<br><a target='_blank' href="http://www.evoluted.net/">evoluted.net</a></p></h5>
				
				<p>Working at Evoluted has been a fantastic experience, and I’m massively enjoying my time here.</p>

				<p>My role is that of “Web Developer”, and it really shows in the work I do - I’m involved in every stage of the development process of a client’s website, from the initial design to the front end templating, and then the main chunk of my work - the backend development.</p>

				<p>For most clients, this involves working out exactly what the client needs and wants, and translating that into features of the site. Usually, this is done by developing any custom functionality that the client specifically needs, and integrating this with our own internal CMS.</p>

					<h5>Pryor Marking Technology<p class='text-muted sans-serif'>March 2014 - December 2014<br>Software Engineer<br><a target='_blank' href="http://www.pryormarking.com/">pryormarking.com</a></p></h5>
					<p>
						So far, my time at Pryor has been really enjoyable - it's a very different environment from High Tech Click, and I've
						enjoyed the exciting challenges that have come from it.
					</p>
					
					<p>My biggest challenge has been a shift in my main working platforms - from websites, to desktop applications. I now work on a single large desktop application written in C# and the .NET framework.</p>

					<p>My day to day activities include designing, planning and implementing new features for this desktop application, fixing bugs arising from unknown conditions (such as hardware changes) and working with my colleagues to write plugins and various adaptations to the system for different custom builds (for specific clients)</p>

					<p>As you can imagine, this is quite a change from working on varied and different projects, not to mention working in a whole new language and domain - however, I’ve enjoyed the opportunity to expand my skill set and get a chance to work on something different.</p>

					<p>Furthermore, due to the nature of the job, I’ve also had the chance to work with a huge number of different hardware components - from cameras and motor axises to gate logic and robotics - something which I would never have had a chance to do while developing websites and web apps. Again, more skills under my belt.</p>

					<p>However, despite all of this, I’ve still had great opportunities to continue stretching my “PHP muscles”, so to speak. Since beginning at Pryor, I have single handedly designed, developed, implemented and maintained a string translation management system and a bug tracker/ticketing system for internal use. Both of these written in PHP/HTML5/CSS3/JQuery, using Amazon EC2 technology for hosting.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h5>High Tech Click (Sister company to Xbite)<p class='text-muted sans-serif'>June 2013 - March 2014<br>Technical Developer<br><a target='_blank' href="http://hightechclick.com/">hightechclick.com</a></p></h5>
					<p>
						My work at HTC was a large technical step-up from the work I was producing at Xbite, and it really gave me a chance to show my skills
						at large scale projects, involving a lot more planning and designing than the (relatively) simpler work I was doing at Xbite. I had opportunities
						to rebuild large parts of the in-house CMS, lots of updates made to front-end features and designing and implementing in-house automated newsletter
						systems.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, the main project I worked on during my time at HTC was something quite a lot larger - a team responsible for redesigning and implementing the entire ecommerce
						system that XBite used, from the “ground-up”. I was a key developer on this project (one of three) and planned, designed and
						implemented entire sections of the system on my own, as well as working on large tasks as part of the entire
						team. This whole system was built using OOP PHP 5.4+ with HTML5 and LESS CSS styling, as well as a bespoke
						version of Zend Framework 2, Doctrine ORM, and Twig Templating.
					</p>
					
					<br>
				
					<h5>Xbite<p class='text-muted sans-serif'>June 2011 - September 2012<br>(University Placement) PHP Developer<br><a target='_blank' href="http://www.xbite.co.uk/">xbite.co.uk</a></p></h5>
					<p>
						I spent 18 months with Xbite working on their web systems , both front facing and CMS. I maintained and
						improved existing features, as well as implementing entirely new features, some single handily (including
						design and planning), others as part of a group.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also had the opportunity to design and craft tailored newsletters that would be sent out bi-weekly to
						contact lists of over 100K people in multiple territories. I was also responsible for updates across various
						Facebook and Twitter accounts, with a total follower base of 50K+.

					<h5>Manor Operatic<p class='text-muted sans-serif'>Single Freelance Client<br><a target='_blank' href="http://www.manoroperatic.com">manoroperatic.com</a></p></h5>
					<p>
						Manor Operatic, one of the largest theatre groups in South Yorkshire and producer of the largest amateur pantomime in England, commissioned me and a friend to
						develop a brand new website for their group. While I had no part in the design, I am very happy with the
						final outcome. It included a full CMS for editing every part of the site , from the content of the front page, to
						each show with accompanying text and images, as well as “members only” password protected areas.
					</p>
					<p>
						The site has continued to grow thanks to Manor Operatic’s maintenance, and now supports a total
						newsletter base of over 600.

								<p>
									For my final project, I had the opportunity to really let loose with my creativity, and try something a bit
									different. I settled on an XNA/C# based level editor for a game, where the user could click and drag icons
									and blocks to create a platform based, 2D level for a game.
								</p>
								<p>
									This game level could then be saved into a text file and read into a web-page. This would then render the
									level exactly as it was created into a playable game, where the character could jump around and  explore
									the level. The web game worked with Javascript and HTML5 canvas technology.
								</p>
								<p>
									The project was an experiment into how children use computers in a creative capacity, and it gave me a
									chance to do some research into some really interesting areas of computing and human-computer
									interaction. I’m proud to say I achieved a First on the project.
