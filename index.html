- Hey, I like peeking at source code too!
- This page uses Bootstrap, a custom theme, and a bit more personal styling for the finishing touches
- I was also gonna use a bit of JS so there was a nice scroll effect when you clicked on the navigation links, but I actually kinda agree with the guy over at http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/

- Copyright Tom Gray, or whatever, I have no idea. Steal my markup, don't, I'm not the police.
