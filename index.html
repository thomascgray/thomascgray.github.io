                    <p>Worked with RESTul APIs exposing complex insurance and referencing data as well as consumer facing SPAs that consumed that data.</p>
                    <p>My primary role at Barbon was working on the Homelet branded insurance and referencing platform in a number of projects aimed at revitalising said platform via a stronger technology infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>I was the lead dev on a project to replace a Symfony 2 monolithic app with an API service, which is now used by thousands of customers annually. I also developed a number of API services aimed at providing easier consumption of read-only insurance data, such as the questions and content that powers SPAs, data on the Barbon insurance products, and information on insurance quotes.</p>
                    <p>I have also helped develop a number of smaller microservices that are used by multiple frontend web apps throughout the greater Barbon product set, such as postcode address lookups and postcode risk flood and subsidence service lookups.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I was also a key part of the team at Barbon developing multiple SPA (single page application) webapps for use with the aforementioned APIs. These SPAs were built in React.js with extensive use of 3rd party libraries (via NPM integration) and entirely in the latest ES6 and modern React development practices. Several key SPA features developed by myself are now in use on multiple production SPAs across the Barbon platform.</p>

                    <p>Technologies used in role: PHP, CakePHP, MySQL, SASS, Gulp, Bootstrap</p>
                    <p>As a backend developer at Evoluted, I rapidly developed bespoke websites for a variety of clients, including internal Evoluted systems. This was done using a full LAMP stack, based around CakePHP and Evoluted’s own CMS. I modified and extended our CMS to suit the particular client’s needs, before taking pre-built HTML templates and wiring up the frontend.</p>
                    <p>I was often required to amend the HTML templates as development work continued, and client requirements evolved - this was doing using the original SASS files, combined with Evoluted’s extensive NPM plugin based workflow.</p>
                    <p>Sites were often worked on by multiple developers before completion - therefore, a comprehensive system of Git and Vagrant was employed by all developers to ensure workspace and project consistency.</p>

                    <p>Employed as a Software Engineer, I worked in C# and the .NET framework on TraceableIT, a marking and traceability software suite. I also designed and developed web apps for internal Pryor use.</p>
                    <p>On TraceableIT I was responsible for the development of new core features, custom modules of functionality for specific clients and vendors, and integrating new hardware as the hardware became available.</p>
                    <p>I developed several web apps for internal use at Pryor, including an entirely bespoke project management tool and a web-based tool to assist in the internationalisation of various Pryor assets. Both of these web apps were built with LAMP stacks, using Laravel 4.2 with a Gulp & SASS based frontend.                   </p>

                    <p>I was employed at HTC as a Technical Developer. I worked on a variety of internal and external web apps and sites, all developed in PHP 5.6 using a custom build of Zend Framework 2, Doctrine ORM, Twig templating and LESS styling.</p>
                    <p>My primary project was as part of a team developing a custom ecommerce platform, designed to handle every aspect of an ecommerce site, from client facing product pages to internal stock management. As part of this team I was responsible for deal and discount systems, asset (banners and ads) CMS management, and I was lead on templating and styling the client-facing frontend.</p>
