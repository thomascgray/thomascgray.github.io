- This page uses Bootstrap, a custom theme, and a bit more personal styling for the finishing touches
- I was also gonna use a bit of JS so there was a nice scroll effect when you clicked on the navigation links, but I actually kinda agree with the guy over at http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/

				<h5>Evoluted <p class='text-muted sans-serif'>December 2014 - Present<br>Web Developer<br><a target='_blank' href="http://www.evoluted.net/">evoluted.net</a></p></h5>				
				<p>Technologies used in role: PHP, CakePHP, MySQL, SASS, Gulp, Bootstrap</p>
				<p>As a backend developer at Evoluted, I rapidly developed bespoke websites for a variety of clients, including internal Evoluted systems. This was done using a full LAMP stack, based around CakePHP and Evoluted’s own CMS. I modified and extended our CMS to suit the particular client’s needs, before taking pre-built HTML templates and wiring up the frontend.</p>
				<p>I was often required to amend the HTML templates as development work continued, and client requirements evolved - this was doing using the original SASS files, combined with Evoluted’s extensive NPM plugin based workflow.</p>
				<p>Sites were often worked on by multiple developers before completion - therefore, a comprehensive system of Git and Vagrant was employed by all developers to ensure workspace and project consistency.</p>

					<p>Employed as a Software Engineer, I worked in C# and the .NET framework on TraceableIT, a marking and traceability software suite. I also designed and developed web apps for internal Pryor use.</p>
					<p>On TraceableIT I was responsible for the development of new core features, custom modules of functionality for specific clients and vendors, and integrating new hardware as the hardware became available.</p>
					<p>I developed several web apps for internal use at Pryor, including an entirely bespoke project management tool and a web-based tool to assist in the internationalisation of various Pryor assets. Both of these web apps were built with LAMP stacks, using Laravel 4.2 with a Gulp & SASS based frontend.					</p>

					<p>I was employed at HTC as a Technical Developer. I worked on a variety of internal and external web apps and sites, all developed in PHP 5.6 using a custom build of Zend Framework 2, Doctrine ORM, Twig templating and LESS styling.</p>
					<p>My primary project was as part of a team developing a custom ecommerce platform, designed to handle every aspect of an ecommerce site, from client facing product pages to internal stock management. As part of this team I was responsible for deal and discount systems, asset (banners and ads) CMS management, and I was lead on templating and styling the client-facing frontend.</p>
