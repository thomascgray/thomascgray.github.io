                <h5>BBC TV & Radio <p class='text-muted sans-serif'>June 2018 - Present<br>Software Engineer - Contract<br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/">bbc.co.uk</a></p></h5>
                <p>Technologies used in role: Node JS, React JS, Emotion JS, Redux</p>

                <p><strong>Working with the discovery team of BBC iPlayer for TVs. Helping design and build a future-proof, maintainable foundation for Home, Channels, Categories, Search and more on BBC iPlayer.</strong></p>
                <p>I've had the pleasure to work across a number of teams for the BBC, aiming to deliver new feature sets and engineering excellence to the discovery mechanisms and playback functionality of iPlayer on "big screens" (TVs, game consoles and set-top boxes). I have also had the opportunity to contribute to a number of team-agnostic projects across the TV platform.</p>
                <p><strong>Optimising a department wide React component library</strong><br />At the start of my contract, the TV React shared component library was only in partial use due to its run time speed issues. I was tasked with identifying the cause and seeing if anything could be done to improve the speed.</p>
                <p>I was able to identify Styled Components JS as a primary cause, as well as the actual composition of the React components themselves. By re-writing the components to increase render speed, and switching to Emotion JS, we were able to actually start making use of the component library in anger.</p>
                <p><strong>Re-architecting “experience” delivery from the server to client</strong><br />I have led an effort to re-think and re-architect how our API services deliver experiences to the iPlayer client. This approach is making extensive use of React, Emotion JS and Redux on the client, helping get iPlayer to a place more closely resembling a modern SPA.</p>
                <p><strong>Initial development of the programme page</strong><br />One of my first large projects was as one of two developers developing a programme page for iPlayer on TVs. This was one of the first sections of iPlayer to make use of the shared component library, and so was an excellent opportunity to deliver a user experience using modern React standards.</p>
                <p><strong>Key developer of the revamped Search experience</strong><br />I helped develop the brand new Search experience, migrating from an entirely client driven system to one delivered through the SSR solution. Built entirely in React, rendered on the server and assembled in the client, the new Search experience increased Search conversion by 8% for users while delivering an experience that is lighter, faster, and easier to maintain.</p>

                <p>Technologies used in role: Node JS, Hapi, Ember JS, Bespoke PHP, C# Integration</p>
                <p><strong>Designing and developing high-availability, secure, fast enterprise Node APIs for the fin-tech market, as well as designing and implementing multiple frontend solutions for both customer and business level users.</strong></p>
                <p>My time at Zeavo was primarily spent working on APIs serving various business needs for multiple clients - specifically, the API powering DebtKit - Zeavo's industry-leading debt management solution.</p>
                <p>This work was primarily enhancing DebtKit, Zeavo’s industry-leading debt management platform. The work was in Node 8, using modern frameworks and technologies (Hapi JS, Joi, async/await, Bluebird JS, etc.) plus numerous intergrations with AWS (S3 Storage, State Machine Workflow Engines)</p>
                <p>I was the lead developer on numerous features, including bespoke implementations of the JSON API specification (inclusion of related resources, filtering, side-posting), file upload and storage solutions (including integration with AWS S3), design of automation and workflow systems.</p>
                <p>I also helped to design and implement numerous front-end feature sets. These were built in either Vue.js, when the feature required integrating with a current PHP frontend, or a standalone Ember JS SPA.</p>
                <p>Frontend features were built with full HTML5 and SCSS specifications in mind, and included complex frontend functionality around state management, refreshing data from the server, accessibility concerns and automated testing.</p>

                <h5>Barbon Insurance Group <p class='text-muted sans-serif'>March 2016 - September 2017 (1 year 6 months)<br>Software Engineer - Contract<br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.barbon.com/">barbon.com</a></p></h5>
                <p>Worked with RESTul APIs exposing complex insurance and referencing data as well as consumer facing SPAs that consumed that data.</p>
                <p>My primary role at Barbon was working on the Homelet branded insurance and referencing platform in a number of projects aimed at revitalising said platform via a stronger technology infrastructure.</p>
                <p>I was the lead dev on a project to replace a Symfony 2 monolithic app with an API service, which is now used by thousands of customers annually. I also developed a number of API services aimed at providing easier consumption of read-only insurance data, such as the questions and content that powers SPAs, data on the Barbon insurance products, and information on insurance quotes.</p>
                <p>I have also helped develop a number of smaller microservices that are used by multiple frontend web apps throughout the greater Barbon product set, such as postcode address lookups and postcode risk flood and subsidence service lookups.</p>
                <p>Finally, I was also a key part of the team at Barbon developing multiple SPA (single page application) webapps for use with the aforementioned APIs. These SPAs were built in React.js with extensive use of 3rd party libraries (via NPM integration) and entirely in the latest ES6 and modern React development practices. Several key SPA features developed by myself are now in use on multiple production SPAs across the Barbon platform.</p>

                <p>Technologies used in role: PHP, CakePHP, MySQL, SASS, Gulp, Bootstrap</p>
                <p>As a backend developer at Evoluted, I rapidly developed bespoke websites for a variety of clients, including internal Evoluted systems. This was done using a full LAMP stack, based around CakePHP and Evoluted’s own CMS. I modified and extended our CMS to suit the particular client’s needs, before taking pre-built HTML templates and wiring up the frontend.</p>
                <p>I was often required to amend the HTML templates as development work continued, and client requirements evolved - this was doing using the original SASS files, combined with Evoluted’s extensive NPM plugin based workflow.</p>
                <p>Sites were often worked on by multiple developers before completion - therefore, a comprehensive system of Git and Vagrant was employed by all developers to ensure workspace and project consistency.</p>

                <p>Employed as a Software Engineer, I worked in C# and the .NET framework on TraceableIT, a marking and traceability software suite. I also designed and developed web apps for internal Pryor use.</p>
                <p>On TraceableIT I was responsible for the development of new core features, custom modules of functionality for specific clients and vendors, and integrating new hardware as the hardware became available.</p>
                <p>I developed several web apps for internal use at Pryor, including an entirely bespoke project management tool and a web-based tool to assist in the internationalisation of various Pryor assets. Both of these web apps were built with LAMP stacks, using Laravel 4.2 with a Gulp & SASS based frontend.                   </p>

                <p>My primary project was as part of a team developing a custom ecommerce platform, designed to handle every aspect of an ecommerce site, from client facing product pages to internal stock management. As part of this team I was responsible for deal and discount systems, asset (banners and ads) CMS management, and I was lead on templating and styling the client-facing frontend.</p>
